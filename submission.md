All papers must be written in English and formatted according to the ACM proceedings format. Submissions must not be more than six (6) pages, and shorter papers are also encouraged. Papers must be submitted in PDF format via the workshop Web site and will be accepted based on relevance to the topics of the workshop, technical contribution, and potential for an interesting discussion. Authors of accepted papers will have the option to publish electronically in the ACM Digital Library.

<strong>Authors take note:</strong> The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.)

Paper submissions will be handled by EasyChair:
