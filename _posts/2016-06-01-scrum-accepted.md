SCRUM has been accepted into [Middleware 2015](http://2015.middleware-conference.org/)! Please visit our [Call for Papers](/cfp) for more information.

Middleware is often constructed from components and interconnects
spanning a wide range of programming languages and frameworks,
executing in environments with unpredictable latencies, unknown
availability, and concurrent demand for resources. Designing,
deploying, and reasoning about consistency models (e.g.,
serializability, snapshot isolation, eventual consistency, etc.) and
invariants (e.g., partial order, equivalence, or generic guarantees,
etc.) involves subtle tradeoffs in terms of fault tolerance,
performance, scalability and programmability.
